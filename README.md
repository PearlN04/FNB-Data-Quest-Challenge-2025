## üåê Overview
This repository contains a machine learning-based recommender system designed to deliver relevant product offers to customers based on their historical interactions, preferences, and contextual data.

Inspired by real-world recommendation engines like those used by Netflix and Amazon, this system aims to enhance personalized customer experiences across digital platforms through context-aware offer ranking and prioritization.

## üåü Problem
Many banks aim to deliver personalized offers by ranking and recommending the most relevant products for each user. The task is to train a machine learning model that uses contextual and behavioral interaction data to recommend relevant financial products for each customer.

This includes:
- Display, click, and checkout interaction logs
- Item types and descriptions
- User segments and activity levels
- Time-of-day and page context data

## üéØ Objectives

* **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess and clean raw data including missing values, standardizing formats, and removing irrelevant rows.
* **Feature Engineering**: Generate new meaningful features such as interaction scores, user-item frequencies, and time-based aggregates.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand user behavior and item popularity trends.
* **Baseline Recommender**: Build a popularity-based recommender to serve as a benchmark.
* **Collaborative Filtering Model**: Train a recommender model using matrix factorization or hybrid methods.
* **Model Evaluation**: Use accuracy and beyond-accuracy metrics (e.g., Precision@K, Recall@K, Hit Rate) to assess the model.
* **Recommendation Output**: Generate top-N recommendations for users and export to file for interpretation or presentation.

## üìö Dataset Description
The original dataset used in this project is proprietary and cannot be shared. 
For demonstration purposes, the code is structured to accept a CSV file with the following columns: [list example columns].

| __Variable__ | __Description__ |
|--------------|------------------|
| `Idcol` | Unique customer identifier |
| `interaction` | Type of interaction: DISPLAY, CLICK, CHECKOUT |
| `int_date` | Date of interaction |
| `item` | Item code (product) interacted with |
| `item_type` | High-level category of the item (e.g., INVEST, LEND, INSURE) |
| `item_descrip` | Description of the item |
| `segment` | Broad income-related customer segment |
| `beh_segment` | Detailed behavioral segment (50 categories) |
| `active_ind` | Customer activity level: Active, Semi Active, Cold Start |
| `page` | Page context of the interaction |
| `tod` | Time-of-day context: Early, Morning, Afternoon, Evening |
